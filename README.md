# Wikipedia Toxic Comment Classification

## Overview : 
#### This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify user comments on Wikipedia into different levels of toxicity. The classifier predicts the probability of each comment belonging to one or more of the following classes:
+ Toxic
+ Severe_Toxic
+ Obscene
+ Threat
+ Insult
+ Identity_Hate

#### Model predicts the probability of each class.

## Models Used : 
+ RandomForest
+ Support Vector Machine
+ Multnomial Naive Bayes'
+ Logistic Regression
+ XGBoost

#### Among these, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was found to perform the best.

## Dataset
#### The dataset used for training and testing the models is from the [Kaggle Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).
